## [TELEGRAM BOT USING PYTHON]

### Summary 

Work From Home has been really stressful owing to the lack of one on one meetups and get togethers. Being at home, our family and pets are the only ones close to us. Pets are really helpful in relieving stress.

Our Bot works in a similar way to help you remain stress free. If you don't have any pet (cases where parents do not let us keep one), our bot will help you by providing cute images of dogs, cats, pandas, birb of various breeds and varieties. In addition you can also get random meme templates to laugh your heart out.

Hope this helps to brighten up your mood!
